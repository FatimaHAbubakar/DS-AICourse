# Overview
This project builds a beginner-level generative text model trained on Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare.

The lab includes:
- Dataset creation and cleaning
- Bigram probabilistic model training
- Text generation
- Model evaluation
- Data visualization
- Insights and limitations

## Dataset
Source: Project Gutenberg (public domain)

## Model
A Bigram Markov Chain model:
P(next_word | current_word)

## Evaluation
- Word frequency comparison
- Sentence length distribution
- Vocabulary size comparison

## How to Run
Open the notebook in Google Colab and run all cells sequentially.
